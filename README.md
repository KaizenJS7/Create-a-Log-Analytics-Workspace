# Create-a-Log-Analytics-Workspace

Let's continue with the deployment of Sentinel. Creating a log analytics workspace is a prerequisite and we already created a resource group, because that's where we will deploy our workspace in. So what we will do
is search for <b>Log Analystics Workspace</b> and click on it.

Then we will click on <b>Create</b>

As with any Azure resource, we need to provide a subscription. In my case, this is already filled and then we select the correct resource group (DemoRG). Then we give a name to the workspace, select the region 
and we click on next.

We will leave this empty.

We will confirm everything is correct, wait for the validation to pass and then click on <b>Create</b>.

Now the Log Analytics workspace is being deployed to the resource group. We will wait for the deployment to complete.

If we click on "<b>Go to resource</b>" we can have a look at the resource and start to deploy Sentinel.
