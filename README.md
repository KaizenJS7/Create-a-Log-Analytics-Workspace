# Create-a-Log-Analytics-Workspace

Let's continue with the deployment of Sentinel. Creating a log analytics workspace is a prerequisite and we already created a resource group, because that's where we will deploy our workspace in. So what we will do
is search for <b>Log Analystics Workspace</b> and click on it.

Then we will click on <b>Create</b>

As with any Azure resource, we need to provide a subscription. In my case, this is already filled and then we select the correct resource group (DemoRG). Then we give a name to the workspace, select the region 
and we click on next.
